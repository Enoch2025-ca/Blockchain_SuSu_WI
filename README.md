## Descreption of the West Indian Caribbean SUSU ##
 In the islands of the Caribbean the natives have a differrent way of saving for large purchase. This way is normally done via family, close friends and co-workers. The form a pool of people, normally more than 5. Then they agree on a amount of money such as $50 to $100 then they agreen upon an interval of time to each person to make these payments. ie. once a month or once every two-weeks. once above is agreed upon. a pay-out schedule is given where all the member recieve the total amount given in a lump sum ie. if 5 persons gave $100 there would be 5 payout of $500. each member. 

 This type of scheme helps the indiviluals save up for large purchase without the need for credit card or bank interest rates. The persons early in the system usually have need for the money in the short term and are responsible to stay and pay back the borrowed money. the later persons are more interested in using this as a saving method that will payout a large sum for them to invest in stocks or other saving options, some times they even roll it into another SUSU with larger payouts to continue growing their savings.
